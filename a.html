<h2>About Me</h2>
<main>

<h2>Because yea I can ...</h2>

<p>There are a many of different kinds of photos and photography style out there. Well this is mine. roam about and see what tickels your fancy. Let me know what you think or if you have any questions.Enjoy reading about me! I'm a paragraph. I'm here to boast, brag and bore you about Bree...I mean uh Ashley. Hopefully I won't bore you with Ms. Minors brief story. Pretty much shes always had a passion for what little beauty surrounded her in the world. She loves taking nature walks with little Jasper (her dog) and while on those walks you'll without a doubt see her whip out her camera to take some shots. Whether its a pretty flower surrounded by weeds, a scene pure beauty at the aweinspiring trees, birds, cloud and sun, Japser playing with that cute poodle from next door or a "selfie"with a gorgeous background .</p>
